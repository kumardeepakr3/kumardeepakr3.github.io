I've started using vim for daily development tasks. Although it's very difficult to get a hold of the commands, it's a boon once you learn it. I don't have to go to mouse to do copy and paste. Everything happens
under your fingertips. Move up & down and sideways. VsVim is an plugin that's available for Visual Studio. I won't say Visual Studio is bad. It's excellent IDE but it isn't used everywhere and hence vim.
Also if one only has access to terminal for a machine. Vim is always available if it's a Linux machine. Let's hope that it helps in future and makes my tasks easier as I learn it more.
