Few days back while browsing through the trending videos on youtube, I encountered that a TV show named 'Kumkum Bhagya' was trending for quite sometime. I also noticed that it wasn't just a single episode that was trending. Everyday the trailer of the next day's episode was trending. I opened one of the vidoes and saw 6 lakh views on it in span of 1 day. This means apart from the people who watch this show on TV, there are a lot of folks who watch it on youtube. I know a lot of my friends who create original content and do youtube videos but none of them have that level of viewers/views. This intrigued me and I started looking at the trending feed more closely. I saw that there were many other TV shows that were trending.

In order to find out what was it that made these shows trend, I decided to watch the entire show of 'Kumkum Bhagya' from episode 1 till episode 1100. I spent a complete weekend to watch these episodes and made notes on the major events that were happenning throughout the show. I only glanced through each episode to understand the event that took place.

Here is the recipe that make this show popular:
1. Revolve the show around main characters who fall in love. But make sure they never meet because you don't want the show to end.
2. Portray 2-3 people as super villians and make them do all sort to crazy stuff to keep the main characters apart. Because you don't have any other goal in life.
3. In case when the two characters meet, make sure that by the end of the episode you make one of them have memory loss. So you can start over again.
4. To bring the two characters closer, have 1 or both of them kidnapped. This way you employ more goons (villians) for the show and bring the main characters together.
5. Bring in 2-3 elder people and portray them as people with immense wisdom. Involve even these people in planning of bringing together our 2 main characters. Yeah, even elders don't have anything to do.
6. Make sure to reveal some major truth to any of the characters only on Friday. This will ensure that the suspense is maintained and people will come back on Monday to see the show again.
7. Bring in 2-3 kids. Let them do some random kids stuff and take away 10mins from the 20min show.
8. In case of a romantic scene, play a bollywood number in background and stretch the shot of 2-3 second to a minute.
9. Introduce a major misunderstanding the create complete chaos in the show. Again this introduces the suspense and keeps the show going.
10. If there is no content for a show, just bring in the kids, elders the 2 main characters and just show some daily activity. You can definitely cover a few minutes. Also you can add flashbacks from previous episodes.
11. In case of a major breakthrough in any episode dedicate the entire episode to that and cover each and every person's emotions completely (happiness, sadness, anger, regret etc). And repeat this after every new sentence is spoken by the breakthrough revealer.
12. Take a good character from the show and make him bad.


That's all I can say about this show. But I can definitely relate these point to lot of other shows that I had seen (forced to see) in my childhood during lunch/dinner.
